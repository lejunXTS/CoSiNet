CoSiNet is a single-object tracking algorithm proposed by Mr. Wenjun Zhou, which is an improved method based on our previous work, SiamDUL.

The code was implemented by Dr. Zhou (zhouwenjun@swpu.edu.cn) and Ms. Liu from the Image Processing and Parallel Computing Laboratory, School of Computer Science, Southwest Petroleum University.

If you need to use it to test your own algorithms, please feel free to download it.

If you intend to use it in your paper, please inform us in advance.

Thank you.
